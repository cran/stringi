\usage{
stri_install_check(silent = FALSE)

stri_install_icudt(check = TRUE, path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{silent}{suppress diagnostic messages}

  \item{check}{enable \code{stri_install_check()} tests}

  \item{path}{path to install icudt to. If \code{NULL},
  then \code{file.path(find.package('stringi'), 'libs')}
  will be used. Custom, non-default paths should not be
  used normally by \pkg{stringi} users.}
}
\value{
The functions return a logical value, invisibly.
\code{TRUE} denotes that the requested operation has been
completed successfully.
}
\description{
These functions are responsible for checking and
guaranteeing that the ICU data library (icudt) is available
and that \pkg{stringi} is ready to use.
}
\details{
ICU makes use of a wide variety of data tables to provide
many of its services. Examples include converter mapping
tables, collation rules, transliteration rules, break
iterator rules and dictionaries, and other locale data.

Without the ICU data library (icudt) many \pkg{stringi}
features will not be available. icudt size is approx. 10-20
MB.

\code{stri_install_check()} tests whether some ICU services
are available. If they are not, it is most likely due to
unavailable ICU data library.

\code{stri_install_icudt()} downloads and installs the ICU
data library specific for your platform
(little/big-endian). The downloaded file will be
decompressed into the directory where the package has been
installed, see \code{\link{find.package}}, so make sure you
have sufficient write permissions.
