\title{Count the Number of Bytes}
\usage{
stri_numbytes(str)
}
\arguments{
\item{str}{character vector or an object coercible to}
}
\value{
Returns an integer vector of the same length as \code{str}.
}
\description{
Counts the number of bytes needed to store
each string in computer's memory.
}
\details{
This is often not the function you would normally use
in your string processing activities. See rather \code{\link{stri_length}}.

For 8-bit encoded strings, this is the same as \code{\link{stri_length}}.
For UTF-8 strings, the returned values may be greater
than the number of code points, as UTF-8 is not a fixed-byte encoding:
one code point may be encoded by 1-4 bytes
(according to the current Unicode standard).

Missing values are handled properly,
as opposed to the built-in \code{\link{nchar}(str, "bytes")} function call.

The strings do not need to be re-encoded to perform this operation.

The returned values does not of course include the trailing NUL bytes,
which are used internally to mark the end of string data (in C).

\examples{
\donttest{
stri_numbytes(letters)
stri_numbytes(c('abc', '123', '\\u0105\\u0104'))

# this used to fail on Windows, as there was no native support for 4-bytes
# Unicode characters; see, however, stri_escape_unicode():
stri_numbytes('\\U7fffffff') # compare stri_length('\\U7fffffff')
}
