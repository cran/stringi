#' Count the Number of Character Class Matches
#'
#' @description
#' This function counts the number of characters that fall into a given
#' character class (e.g. letters, digits, or white spaces).
#'
#' @details
#' Vectorized over \code{str} and \code{pattern}.
#'
#' @param str character vector to search in
#' @param pattern character vector specifying character classes to match,
#' see \link{stringi-search-charclass}
#' @return Returns an integer vector.
#'
#' @examples
#' \dontshow{if (stri_install_check(silent=TRUE))}
#' stri_count_charclass(c("stRRRingi", "STrrrINGI", "123"),
#'    c("\\p{Ll}", "\\p{Lu}", "\\p{Zs}"))
#'
#' \dontshow{if (stri_install_check(silent=TRUE))}
#' stri_count_charclass(" \t\n", "\\p{WHITE_SPACE}") # white space - binary property
#'
#' \dontshow{if (stri_install_check(silent=TRUE))}
#' stri_count_charclass(" \t\n", "\\p{Z}") # whitespace - general category (note the difference)
