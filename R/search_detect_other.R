#' Detect a Pattern Match
#'
#' @details
#' A convenience function.
#' Calls either \code{\link{stri_detect_regex}},
#' \code{\link{stri_detect_fixed}}, \code{\link{stri_detect_coll}},
#' or \code{\link{stri_detect_charclass}},
#' depending on the argument used.
#'
#' @details
#' Unless you are very lazy, please call the underlying functions
#' directly for better performance.
#'
#' @param str character vector of strings to search in
#' @param ... additional arguments passed to the underlying functions
#' @param regex character vector; regular expressions
#' @param fixed character vector; fixed patterns
#' @param coll character vector; canonically equivalent patterns
#' @param charclass character vector; identifiers of character classes
#'
#' @return Returns a logical vector.
