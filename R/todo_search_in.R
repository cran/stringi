# #' @title
# #' Value Matching
# #'
# #' @description
# #' For each element in \code{str}, this function returns
# #' a position of the first matching element in \code{table}.
# #'
# #' @details
# #' Vectorized over \code{str}.
# #'
# #' This is a dummy wrapper for R's \code{\link{match}} function.
# #' The only difference is that it ensures that the comparison
# #' is made in UTF-8 (by calling \code{\link{stri_enc_toutf8}}).
# #'
# #' It is (most likely) impossible to implement an algorithm
# #' faster than the built-in \code{\link{match}}:
# #' this function uses R's clever, hash table-based, string caching
# #' system directly.
# #'
# #' @param str character vector of strings to search in
# #' @param table character vector of values to be matched against
# #' @param ... further arguments passed to \code{\link{match}}
# #'
# #' @return Returns an integer vector.
# #'
# #' @export
# #' @family search_in
# stri_in_fixed <- function(str, table, ...) {
#    match(stri_enc_toutf8(str), stri_enc_toutf8(table), ...)
# }
