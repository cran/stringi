#' @title
#' Count the Number of Text Boundaries
#'
#' @description
#' This function determines the number of specific text boundaries
#' (like character, word, line, or sentence boundaries) in a string.
#'
#' @details
#' Vectorized over \code{str}.
#'
#' For more information on the text boundary analysis
#' performed by \pkg{ICU}'s \code{BreakIterator}, see
#' \link{stringi-search-boundaries}.
#'
#' In case of \code{stri_count_words},
#' just like in \code{\link{stri_extract_all_words}} and
#' \code{\link{stri_locate_all_words}},
#' \pkg{ICU}'s word \code{BreakIterator} iterator is used
#' to locate word boundaries, and all non-word characters
#' (\code{UBRK_WORD_NONE} rule status) are ignored.
#' This is function is equivalent to a call to
#' \code{\link{stri_count_boundaries}(str, type="word", skip_word_none=TRUE, locale=locale)}
#'
#' Note that a \code{BreakIterator} of type \code{character}
#' may be used to count the number of \emph{Unicode characters} in a string.
#' This may lead to different results than that returned by the
#' \code{\link{stri_length}} function, which is designed to return
#' the number of \emph{Unicode code points}.
#'
#' On the other hand, a \code{BreakIterator} of type \code{sentence}
#' may be used to count the number of sentences in a piece of text.
#'
#'
#' @param str character vector or an object coercible to
#' @param opts_brkiter a named list with \pkg{ICU} BreakIterator's settings
#' as generated with \code{\link{stri_opts_brkiter}};
#' \code{NULL} for default break iterator, i.e. \code{line_break}
#' @param ... additional settings for \code{opts_brkiter}
#' @param locale \code{NULL} or \code{""} for text boundary analysis following
#' the conventions of the default locale, or a single string with
#' locale identifier, see \link{stringi-locale}
#'
#' @return
#' Both functions return an integer vector.
#'
#' @examples
