#' @title
#' Split a String By Regex Pattern Matches
#'
#' @description
#' Splits each element of \code{str} into substrings.
#' A \code{pattern} indicates delimiters that separate
#' the input into fields. The input data between the matches become
#' the fields themselves.
#'
#' @details
#' Vectorized over \code{str}, \code{pattern}, \code{n_max},
#' and \code{omit_empty}.
#'
#' If \code{n_max} is negative (default), then all pieces are extracted.
#'
#' \code{omit_empty} is applied during splitting: if set to \code{TRUE},
#' then empty strings will never appear in the resulting vector.
#'
#' Note that if you want to split a string by characters from a
#' specific class (e.g. whitespaces), \code{\link{stri_split_charclass}}
#' will be a little bit faster.
#'
#' @param str character vector with strings to search in
#' @param pattern pattern character; regular expressions
#' @param n_max integer vector, maximal number of pieces to return
#' @param omit_empty logical vector; determines whether empty
#' strings should be removed from the result
#' @param opts_regex a named list with \pkg{ICU} Regex settings
#' as generated with \code{\link{stri_opts_regex}}; \code{NULL}
#' for default settings
#'
#' @return Returns a list of character vectors.
#'
