#' Passing Arguments to Functions in \pkg{stringi}
#'
#' @description
#' Below we explain how \pkg{stringi} deals (in almost all cases)
#' with its functions' arguments.
#'
#' @section Coercion of Arguments:
#'
#' When a character vector argument is expected, factors and other vectors
#' coercible to characters vectors
#' are silently converted with \code{\link{as.character}},
#' otherwise an error is generated.
#'
#' When a logical, numeric or integer vector argument is expected,
#' factors are converted with \code{as.*(\link{as.character}(...))},
#' and other coercible vectors
#' are converted with \code{as.*},
#' otherwise an error is generated.
#'
#'
#'
#' See the links below for the description of internal methods used
#' in all functions from the \pkg{stringi} package (just to get more insight,
#' in case you are interested in technical details).
#' Anyway, we hope that everything works as you intuitively expect.
#'
#' @section Vectorization:
#'
#' Almost all functions are vectorized with respect to all their arguments;
#' This may sometimes lead to strange results - we assume you know what
#' you are doing. However, thanks to this property you may
#' e.g. search for one pattern in each given string,
#' or search for each pattern in one given string.
#'
#' We of course took great care of performance issues: e.g. in regular expression
#' searching, regex matchers are reused
#' from iteration to iteration, as long it is possible.
#'
#' Functions with some non-vectorized arguments are rare:
#' e.g. regular expression matcher's settings are established
#' once per each call.
#'
#' Some functions
#' assume that a vector with one element is given
#' as an argument (like \code{collapse} in \code{\link{stri_join}}).
#' In such cases, if an empty vector is given you will get an error
#' and for vectors with more than 1 elements - a warning will be
#' generator (only the first element will be used).
#'
#' You may find details on vectorization behavior in the man pages
#' on each particular function of your interest.
#'
#' @section Handling Missing Values (\code{NA}s):
#'
#' \pkg{stringi} handles missing values consistently.
#' For any vectorized operation, if at least one vector element is missing,
#' then the corresponding resulting value is also set to \code{NA}.
#'
#' @section Preserving Input Objects' Attributes:
#'
#' Generally, all our functions drop input objects' attributes
#' (e.g. \code{\link{names}}, \code{\link{dim}}, etc.).
#' This is generally because
#' of advanced vectorization and for efficiency reasons.
#' Currently, there is only one exception to this rule:
#' the \code{\link{stri_sort}} function.
#' Thus, if this is needed, please remember to copy important attributes manually
#' or use e.g. the subsetting operation like \code{x[] <- stri_...(x, ...)}.
