#' @title
#' Detect a Regex Pattern Match
#'
#' @description
#' This function checks if there is at least one match to a regex pattern
#' in a string.
#'
#' @details
#' Unless you are very lazy, please call the underlying functions
#' directly for better performance.
#'
#' Vectorized over \code{str} and \code{pattern}.
#'
#' If \code{pattern} is empty, then the result is \code{NA}
#' and a warning is generated.
#'
#' @param str character vector of strings to search in
#' @param pattern character vector of regular expressions
#' @param opts_regex a named list with \pkg{ICU} Regex settings
#' as generated with \code{\link{stri_opts_regex}}; \code{NULL}
#' for default settings
#'
#' @return Returns a logical vector.
#'
#' @examples
#' stri_detect_regex(c("stringi R", "REXAMINE","123"), 'R.')
#' stri_detect_regex(c("stringi R", "REXAMINE","123"), '[[:alpha:]]*?')
#' stri_detect_regex(c("stringi R", "REXAMINE","123"), '[a-zC1]')
#' stri_detect_regex(c("stringi R", "REXAMINE","123"), '( R|RE)')
#' stri_detect_regex("stringi", "STRING.", opts_regex=stri_opts_regex(case_insensitive=TRUE))
