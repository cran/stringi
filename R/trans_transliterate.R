#' General Text Transforms, Including Transliteration
#'
#' @description
#' \pkg{ICU} General transforms provide a general-purpose package
#' for processing Unicode text. They are a powerful and flexible mechanism
#' for handling a variety of different tasks, including:
#' \itemize{
#' \item    Upper Case, Lower Case, Title Case, Full/Halfwidth conversions,
#' \item    Normalization,
#' \item    Hex and Character Name conversions,
#' \item    Script to Script conversion/transliteration.
#' }
#'
#'
#' @details
#' \pkg{ICU} Transforms were mainly designed to transliterate characters
#' from one script to another (for example, from Greek to Latin,
#' or Japanese Katakana to Latin).
#' However, the services performed here represent a much more
#' general mechanism capable of handling a much broader range of tasks.
#' In particular, the Transforms include pre-built transformations
#' for case conversions, for normalization conversions, for the removal
#' of given characters, and also for a variety of language and script
#' transliterations. Transforms can be chained together to perform
#' a series of operations and each step of the process can use a
#' UnicodeSet to restrict the characters that are affected.
#'
#' To get the list of available transforms,
#' call \code{\link{stri_trans_list}}.
#'
#' Note that transliterators are often combined in sequence
#' to achieve a desired transformation.
#' This is analogous to the composition of mathematical functions.
#' For example, given a script that converts lowercase ASCII characters
#' from Latin script to Katakana script, it is convenient to first
#' (1) separate input base characters and accents, and then (2)
#' convert uppercase to lowercase.
#' To achieve this, a compound transform can be specified as follows:
#' \code{NFKD; Lower; Latin-Katakana;}
#'
#' @param str character vector
#' @param id a single string with transform identifier,
#' see \code{\link{stri_trans_list}}
#' @return
#' Returns a character vector.
