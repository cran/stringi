#' Reverse Each String
#'
#' @description
#' Reverses code points in every string.
#'
#' @details
#' Note that this operation may result in non-Unicode-normalized
#' strings and may give strange output for bidirectional strings.
#'
#' See also \code{\link{stri_rand_shuffle}} for a random permutation
#' of code points.
#'
#' @param str character vector
#'
#' @return Returns a character vector.
#'
#' @examples
#'
#' \dontshow{if (stri_install_check(silent=TRUE))}
#' stri_reverse(c("123", "abc d e f"))
#'
#' \dontshow{if (stri_install_check(silent=TRUE))}
#' stri_reverse("ZXY (\u0105\u0104123$^).")
#'
#' \dontshow{if (stri_install_check(silent=TRUE))}
#' stri_reverse(stri_trans_nfd('\u0105')) == stri_trans_nfd('\u0105') # A, ogonek -> agonek, A
