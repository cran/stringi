#' Count the Number of Fixed Pattern Matches
#'
#' @description
#' This function counts the number of occurrences
#' of a fixed pattern in a string.
#'
#' @details
#' Vectorized over \code{str} and \code{pattern}.
#'
#' If \code{pattern} is empty, then the result is \code{NA}
#' and a warning is generated.
#'
#' For natural language processing this function may be not give
#' you desired results. Refer to \link{stringi-search-fixed} for more details.
#'
#' @param str character vector
#' @param pattern character vector
#'
#' @return Returns an integer vector with the number of matches.
