#' [DRAFT API] Detect Character Set and Language
#'
#' @description
#' This function uses the \pkg{ICU} engine to determine the character set,
#' or encoding, of character data in an unknown format.
#'
#' @details
#' Vectorized over \code{str} and \code{filter_angle_brackets}.
#'
#' This is, at best, an imprecise operation using statistics and heuristics.
#' Because of this, detection works best if you supply at least a few hundred
#' bytes of character data that's mostly in a single language.
#' However, Because the detection only looks at a limited amount of the input
#' byte data, some of the returned charsets may fail to handle the
#' all of input data. Note that in some cases,
#' the language can be determined along with the encoding.
#'
#' Several different techniques are used for character set detection.
#' For multi-byte encodings, the sequence of bytes is checked for legal patterns.
#' The detected characters are also check against a list of frequently
#' used characters in that encoding. For single byte encodings, the data
#' is checked against a list of the most commonly occurring three letter groups
#' for each language that can be written using that encoding.
#'
#' The detection process can be configured to optionally ignore
#' HTML or XML style markup (using \pkg{ICU}'s internal facilities),
#' which can interfere with the detection
#' process by changing the statistics.
#'
#' This function should most often be used for byte-marked input strings,
#' especially after loading them from text files and before the main
#' conversion with \code{\link{stri_encode}}.
#' The input encoding is of course not taken into account here, even
#' if marked.
#'
#' The following table shows all the encodings that can be detected:

#'    \item \code{Confidence} -- numeric in [0,1]; the higher the value,
#'    the more confidence there is in the match; \code{NA} on failure.
#' }
#' The guesses are ordered w.r.t. nonincreasing confidence.

#' @title
#' [DRAFT API] Detect Locale-Sensitive Character Encoding
#'
#' @description
#' This function tries to detect character encoding
#' in case the language of text is known.
#'
#' \bold{[THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FUNCTION]}
#'
#' @details
#' Vectorized over \code{str}.
#'
#' First, the text is checked whether it is valid
#' UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-8
#' (as in \code{\link{stri_enc_detect}},
#' this slightly bases on \pkg{ICU}'s \code{i18n/csrucode.cpp},
#' but we do it in our own way, however) or ASCII.
#'
#'
#' If \code{locale} is not \code{NA} and the above fails,
#' the text is checked for the number of occurrences
#' of language-specific code points (data provided by the \pkg{ICU} library)
#' converted to all possible 8-bit encodings
#' that fully cover the indicated language.
#' The encoding is selected basing on the greatest number of total
#' byte hits.
#'
#' The guess is of course imprecise
#' [\bold{This is DRAFT API - still does not work as expected}],
#' as it is obtained using statistics.
#' Because of this, detection works best if you supply at least a few hundred
#' bytes of character data that's in a single language.
#'
#'
#' If you have no initial guess on language and encoding, try with
#' \code{\link{stri_enc_detect}} (uses \pkg{ICU} facilities).
#' However, it turns out that (empirically) \code{stri_enc_detect2}
#' works better than the \pkg{ICU}-based one if UTF-* text
#' is provided. Test yourself.
#'
#' @param str character vector, a raw vector, or
#' a list of \code{raw} vectors
#' @param locale \code{NULL} or \code{""}
#' for default locale,
#' \code{NA} for just checking the UTF-* family,
#' or a single string with locale identifier.
#'
#' @return
#' Just like \code{\link{stri_enc_detect}},
#' this function returns a list of length equal to the length of \code{str}.
#' Each list element is a list with the following three named components:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item \code{Encoding} -- string; guessed encodings; \code{NA} on failure
#'    (iff \code{encodings} is empty),
#'    \item \code{Language} -- always \code{NA},
#'    \item \code{Confidence} -- numeric in [0,1]; the higher the value,
#'    the more confidence there is in the match; \code{NA} on failure.
#' }
#' The guesses are ordered w.r.t. nonincreasing confidence.
