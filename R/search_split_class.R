#' @title
#' Split a String by a Character Class
#'
#' @description
#' Splits each element of \code{str} into substrings.
#' \code{pattern} indicates delimiters that separate
#' the input into fields. The input data between the matches become
#' the fields themselves.
#'
#' @details
#' Vectorized over \code{str}, \code{pattern}, \code{n_max},
#' and \code{omit_empty}.
#'
#' If \code{n_max} is negative (default), then all pieces are extracted.
#'
#' \code{omit_empty} is applied during the split process: if it is
#' set to \code{TRUE},
#' then empty strings will never appear in the resulting vector.
#'
#' @param str character vector with strings to search in
#' @param pattern character vector specifying character classes to match,
#' see \link{stringi-search-charclass}
#' @param n_max integer vector, maximal number of pieces to return
#' @param omit_empty logical vector; determines whether empty
#' strings should be removed from the result
#'
#' @return Returns a list of character vectors.
#'
#'
#' @examples
#' stri_split_charclass("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", "\\p{WHITE_SPACE}")
#' stri_split_charclass(" Lorem  ipsum dolor", "\\p{WHITE_SPACE}", n=3,
#'    omit_empty=c(FALSE, TRUE))
