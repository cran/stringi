#' Query Default Settings for \pkg{stringi}
#'
#' @description
#' Presents current default settings used by the \pkg{ICU} library.
#'
#' @param short logical; whether or not the results should be given
#' in a concise form; defaults to \code{TRUE}
#'
#' @return If \code{short==TRUE}, then a single string containing
#' information on default character encoding, locale, and Unicode
#' as well as \pkg{ICU} version is returned.
#'
#' Otherwise, you a list with the following components is returned:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{Unicode.version} -- version of Unicode supported by the \pkg{ICU} library;
#' \item \code{ICU.version} -- \pkg{ICU} library version used;
#' \item \code{Locale} -- contains information on default locale,
#' as returned by \code{\link{stri_locale_info}};
#' \item \code{Charset.internal} -- always \code{c("UTF-8", "UTF-16")};
#' \item \code{Charset.native} -- information on default encoding,
#' as returned by \code{\link{stri_enc_info}}.
#' }
#'
#' @export
#' @family locale, encoding
