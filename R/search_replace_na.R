#' Replace Missing Values in a Character Vector
#'
#' @description
#' This function offers a convenient way to replace each \code{NA}
#' in a character vector with a given string.
#'
#' @details
#' This function is roughly equivalent to
#' \code{str2 <- stri_enc_toutf8(str);
#' str2[is.na(str2)] <- stri_enc_toutf8(replacement);
#' str2}.
#' It may be used e.g. wherever ``plain \R'' \code{NA} handling is
#' desired, see Examples.
#'
#' @param str character vector or an object coercible to
#' @param replacement single string
#'
#' @return Returns a character vector.
#'
#' @examples
#' x <- c('test', NA)
#' stri_paste(x, 1:2)                           # "test1" NA
#' paste(x, 1:2)                                # "test 1" "NA 2"
#' stri_paste(stri_replace_na(x), 1:2, sep=' ') # "test 1" "NA 2"
#'
#' @export
#' @family search_replace
stri_replace_na <- function(str, replacement="NA"){
   .Call(C_stri_replace_na, str, replacement)
}
